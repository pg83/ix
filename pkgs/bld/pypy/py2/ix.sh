{# Host CPython 2 for the RPython translator.

   rpython imports ctypes on the way in: rlib/rthread casts through
   ll2ctypes, whose _setup_ctypes_cache() reaches straight for
   ctypes.c_long. The stock bld/python/2 has no _ctypes, so the
   translation dies before it starts. Everything else it needs is
   already there. #}

{# ll2ctypes resolves translation-time external calls with ctypes. In a
   static world CDLL of a freshly built .so cannot work, so the symbols
   have to be reachable through the process-wide dl table instead:
   wrap_rdynamic registers everything this binary links. #}
