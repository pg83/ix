{# wasi-libc, the C library behind every wasi32 target here.

   Since wasi-sdk-26 the project builds with CMake, and the target is
   chosen by TARGET_TRIPLE. The old wasm32-wasi spelling is still
   accepted -- it means preview 1, the same as wasm32-wasip1 -- so the
   variants keep the names their consumers key on.

   Two of its cmake helpers reach for the network when a tool is not
   found: bindings.cmake downloads wit-bindgen to regenerate headers,
   and builtins.cmake fetches compiler-rt to link libc.so. Neither is
   needed. The headers are committed, and the shared library is not
   built at all in a static distribution; with BUILD_SHARED off the
   copy of libc.so never enters the default target, and with it goes
   the only consumer of the builtins download. compiler-rt reaches the
   final link through lib/c/bare, next to this library, as before. #}

{# musl's exit.c and quick_exit.c alias __stdio_exit and __funcs_on_exit to
   an unprototyped dummy(). On wasm an unprototyped definition takes the
   varargs pointer, so the weak aliases get the signature (i32) -> void
   while the real functions are () -> void. Without LTO the strong
   definitions replace them silently; under ThinLTO wasm-ld sees both,
   warns about the mismatch and crashes linking executables. #}
