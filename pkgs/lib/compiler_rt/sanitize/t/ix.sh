{#
Some of the intercepted symbols will never be used in IX, or at least when building
with musl. These symbols should be listed here. For them, we create a fake `__real_XXX`
that does nothing, and remove the definition provided by the sanitizer.

The symbols listed in this parent template are used by all sanitizers and come from
`compiler-rt/lib/sanitizer_common/sanitizer_common_interceptors.inc`.
Child templates can add more.

{#
The sanitizer runtime will provide a definiton of `XXX` symbol (which is aliased
to `___interceptor_XXX`) for each intercepted `XXX`. With patches above,
`___interceptor_XXX` now depends on `__real_XXX`, which is the intercepted
function that is supposed to be provided by one of the dependencies
of the final linked binary.

Here, we collect all `XXX` symbols and save them in `intercepted_symbols.txt`
(taking care of the symbols listed in the `non_intercepted_symbols` block first),
so that we can later rename every intercepted `XXX` to `__real_XXX` in
the dependencies.
