"""Emit a cffi module's C source instead of compiling it to a .so.

The build scripts in lib_pypy end in ffi.compile(), which produces a
shared object. Nothing can dlopen one here, so the module is compiled
into the interpreter instead and its C is all that is wanted. cffi
already knows how to hand that over: emit_c_code() writes the same
source compile() would have built, with both entry points in it --
PyInit_<name> and, under #ifdef PYPY_VERSION, _cffi_pypyinit_<name>.

So: watch set_source() for the FFI objects a script builds, turn
compile() into a no-op so a script that probes by compiling still
reaches the end, and write out the one that was asked for.

set_source() also carries the rest of what the module needs to build:
extra C files and include directories. Those go into a sidecar file
rather than being spelled out again in the recipe, so a module that
changes what it vendors does not need the recipe changed with it.
