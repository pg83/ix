{# claude as a single file: the stub built next door, with the upstream
   binary appended to it. No PT_INTERP rewriting and no LD_LIBRARY_PATH —
   the stub stays the process's main executable, which is what keeps solo's
   static TLS pad in place for the guest's own thread-local storage.

   The stub arrives through lib_deps rather than bld_tool because only that
   path keeps the target: bld deps are built for the host. kind=bin on the
   reference overrides the kind=lib that lib_deps would otherwise impose,
   and libdlfcn_ver=elf rides down the whole closure so every lib/dlfcn in
   it resolves to solo's implementation rather than the default one. #}
