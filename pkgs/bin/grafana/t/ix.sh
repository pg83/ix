# Grafana's repo is a go.work workspace: the root go.mod carries
# `replace github.com/grafana/grafana/apps/X => ./apps/X` directives
# that only resolve inside a workspace. aux/go/v3 runs `go mod tidy`
# on every go.mod individually with GOWORK=off, which breaks both
# directions: submodules can't see intra-repo imports, and the root's
# own `replace => ./X` fails once the submodule go.mod vanishes.
#
# Collapse the tree into a single module: drop every non-root
# go.mod/go.sum (so submodule code is just subpackages of the root
# module), strip the matching `replace => ./X` lines (they have no
# targets anymore), and nuke testdata fixtures + go.work.

find . -name '*_test.go' -delete
# Fold every submodule's pins into the root first. `go mod tidy` walks
# all packages in the module, so once the collapse makes submodule code
# root code, their imports need versions — and with the submodule go.mod
# already gone, tidy resolves them to whatever upstream published today.
# That is what kept rotting the recorded hash: pkg/build pins
# dagger.io/dagger v0.18.8 and gqlgen v0.17.73, and tidy was pulling
# newer ones. Conflicting versions across submodules are fine, MVS picks
# the max in tidy right after.
